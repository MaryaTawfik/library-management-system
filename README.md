Yesterday
write a commit that tell i remove unecessary files
Here’s a clean and conventional commit message you can use:

bash
chore: remove unnecessary files and clean up repo
If you want to be more specific, you could tailor it like:

bash
chore: delete unused config and test files from backend
Or even:

bash
chore: remove redundant assets and outdated scripts
Want help writing a commit message that also explains why those files were removed (e.g. post-merge cleanup, outdated logic, etc.)? I can help you phrase that too.

Authentication: JWT

File Uploads: Stored as image URLs or paths

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git

Install dependencies

bash
cd backend && npm install  
cd ../frontend && npm install
Set up environment variables

Backend: .env for DB URI, JWT secret, etc.

Frontend: .env for API base URL

Run the app

bash
cd backend && npm run dev  
cd ../frontend && npm start
📌 Notes
Payments are manually verified by the admin.

Borrowing is disabled until membership is approved.

Admin actions are protected by role-based middleware.

Let me know if you want to include setup instructions for Render deployment or sample API endpoints from your Postman collection. I can also help you write a short contributor guide or add badges for GitHub.

Today
Do you want me to also include example screenshots (frontend UI, API test in Postman) in the README so it looks professional on GitHub?
Absolutely, Marya — adding example screenshots is a fantastic idea! It instantly makes your README more engaging and helps visitors understand your app’s flow without digging into the code. Here’s how you can use them strategically:

📸 Suggested Screenshot Sections
1. Homepage / Book Catalog
Show how users browse books without logging in.

Highlight search or filter features.

2. Membership Payment Flow
Screenshot of the payment form (upload screenshot + transaction ID).

Confirmation message or pending status.

3. Admin Dashboard
Overview of book management, user list, and payment approvals.

Actions like block/unblock, approve/reject return requests.

4. Postman API Tests
Show a successful POST /borrow request.

Example of GET /payments or PATCH /approve-membership.

🖼️ How to Add Them in Markdown

Just make sure your screenshots are clear, cropped to the relevant section, and stored in a screenshots/ folder in your repo.

If you want, I can help you write captions or annotate the screenshots to explain what’s happening in each one. Want to go that extra mile? Add a short GIF demo of the user flow. It’ll make your project shine.
